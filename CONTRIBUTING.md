# Contributor Guidelines

## Introduction

Welcome to the Strangelove contributor guidelines. We are excited to have you here and look forward to your contributions!
Contributors are expected to adhere to the guidelines outlined in this document as well as our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

##  Contributing

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation,
submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into the project itself.

### Bug Reports

First thing to note is that if you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability *DO NOT* use the public issue tracker.
Please read our [security policy](./SECURITY.md) for more information on reporting security vulnerabilities.

When creating a bug report, please use the [template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml) and include as much
detail as possible. At a minimum be sure to include the following:
- What you were trying to do
- How the bug can be reproduced
- What you expected to happen
- What version of the software you were using

### Feature Requests & Enhancements

Feature requests and other enhancements can be made using the [template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml) provided.
Please provide as much detail as possible, including the problem you are trying to solve and the solution you would like to see,
along with possible alternatives you have considered if applicable. Understanding the use cases and the benefits the new feature
or enhancement would bring to users helps the team to prioritize and implement the feature.

### Doc Changes

Documentation changes are always welcome. If you see a typo, or would like to improve the documentation in any way feel
free to open a PR. If you are unsure about the changes you would like to make or if the changes go well beyond
addressing simple grammar mistakes or formatting, open an issue to discuss the changes before opening a PR.

### Opening PRs

When opening new PRs it is advised to open an issue first to discuss the changes you would like to make.
This helps to ensure that the changes are in line with the project goals and that the team is aware of the changes being made
so that duplicate efforts are not made and everyone's time is used efficiently.

When opening a PR, please ensure that the PR description includes the issue number that the PR is addressing.
This helps to ensure that the PR is linked to the issue and that the issue is closed when the PR is merged.


### Contributor License Agreement

Before opening a PR, please review LICENSE.md and familiarize yourself with its terms.
Please be advised that by opening a PR, you are granting Strangelove (or the owner of the relevant repository) a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license, in copyright and in patent, with respect to your
