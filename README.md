ðŸŒŒ Why use Horcrux?
=============================

Tired of answering PagerDuty in the middle of the night? Eliminate the risk of double-signing, and harden and streamline your node ops.

ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ Who benefits from Horcrux?
=============================

Node operators who like their beauty sleep.


ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ What exactly does Horcrux do?
=============================

Separate out signing, and node operations and ensure High Availability of signing keys by sharding. Horcrux is a [multi-party-computation (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) signing service for CometBFT (Formerly known as Tendermint) nodes.

- Composed of a cluster of signer nodes in place of the [remote signer](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/remote-signer.html), enabling High Availability (HA) for block signing through fault tolerance.
- Secure your validator private key by splitting it across multiple private signer nodes using threshold Ed25519 signatures
- Add security and availability without sacrificing block sign performance.



ðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒðŸŒŒ How do I use Horcrux?
=============================

## Running Horcrux

See documentation in [`docs/migrating.md`](/docs/migrating.md) to learn how to upgrade your validator infrastructure with Horcrux.

## Design

Validator operators balance operational and risk tradeoffs to avoid penalties via slashing for liveliness faults or double signing blocks.

Traditional high-availability systems where the keys exist on hot spares risk double signing if there are failover detection bugs. Low-availability systems, or manual failover, risk downtime if manual intervention cannot respond in a timely manner.

Multi-party computation using threshold signatures is able to provide high-availability while maintaining high security and avoiding double signing via consensus and failover detection mechanisms.

The initial threshold signing code in this project was developed by Roman Shtylman (@defunctzombie). The work here improves the cluster reliability and performance, adds a nice CLI experience and additional documentation to make operating this software easier and more reliable.
